# exploitation2

Scenario
Using your newfound knowledge of Python, create a program that will collect keywords from a web page and use them to perform a brute force attack against an exposed admin area.

Goals
The goals of this lab are to:

Collect names and departments from a web page using Python

Feed those names to a Python-based brute-forcing mechanism that will help you obtain access to the admin area

What you will learn
In this lab, you will learn about:

Web scrapping using Python

Basic usage of Python Requests and BeautifulSoup modules

Writing a simple brute-forcing script in Python

Recommended tools
Kali Linux machine (with the default installation of Python 2.7.x)

Web Browser

Tasks
Task 1: Connect to the virtual environment and browse the web page
The lab's range is 172.16.120.0/24.

Using the provided VPN file, connect to the virtual environment. Then, navigate to http://172.16.120.120 and go through it to identify any functionality.

Task 2: Develop a brute-forcing script in Python, that will use employee details as credentials
It is not uncommon to come across an employee's name being used as a username. It is also not uncommon to see an employee's department being used as a password. Corporate sites usually include these pieces of information.

Collecting such information by hand, can be a tedious procedure. So, use Python to collect them (scrape them) and also create a brute-forcing script that will use the collected information as credentials. Use the brute-forcing script against the Admin Area.

In this task, you should:

Use Python's "requests" library

Use Python's "beautifulsoup" library

Pay attention to the basic authentication mechanism
